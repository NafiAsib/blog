<WIP />

> [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) is a simple, lightweight (< 1 KB), open source and privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics. It doesnâ€™t use cookies and is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR. You can self-host or have us run Plausible for you in the cloud. Here's [the live demo of our own website stats](https://plausible.io/plausible.io). Made and hosted in the EU ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º

This is what Plausible claims to be. I was looking for a solution for analytics. Analytics is one of the most important part of a website but getting this right can be tricky (at least in my experience ðŸ˜…)

Plausible has a whopping 15K+ stars in [GitHub](https://github.com/plausible/analytics), so I said to myself "This thing has to be good! ðŸ’¡"

I have small but free VM on Oracle Cloud where I typically self-host my services and pray to god that Oracle doesnâ€™t delete this someday. The goal is to integrate Plausible with a Next.js 13 (App Router) web application.
