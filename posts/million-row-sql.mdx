<WIP />

So there I am chilling in my workspace, waiting for my interview to start. I was interviewing for a senior full stack engineer role.
I knew there would be some questions related to system design. What could go wrong? I know basic stuffs, I self host my projects bare metal with K8s!
I have decent networking knowledge. I can answer how to scale a system, how to make it fault tolerant, how to make it secure etc. Or so I thought!!
The thing is, the last time I gave a proper interview was years ago, as a junior engineer. 
{/* I did well, got offers, joined a company, worked for years, got promoted, got comfortable,
led a frontend team. But I didn't like being a senior frontend engineer. Don't get me wrong, it's fun. But I just wanted to be part of something more.
So, I start looking */}
Throughout my career I only got to work with early stage projects. These projects don't have millions of users or that much volume in data.
So, when my interviewer asked me how I would design a system that can handle 40 millions of rows in a database, I was stuck. The funny part is,
I know the answer theoretically. I know you need have solid indexing & logical partitioning. 
Sharding your database should be the one of the last resort. That's it! I just know these.
Heck, I don't even know how to implement these. I never faced with any situations that closely resembles this.
Seeing my struggle, the interviewer asked me to design a system that'll have millions of requests. How would I handle the servers?
These should've been easy, right? I know how to scale a system. I know how to make it fault tolerant. I know how to make it secure.
But I didn't!! Oh, what an embarrassment! I was so excited by this opportunity. It was a organization that I've been following for some times.

{/* This post is getting more personal than I intended. Let's just stop here. How can I be confident in my skills if I don't have the experience?
So, the easy answer is, let's get experience. But how? I can't just go and work for a company that has millions of users. But I can simulate the situations.
Oh, what an easy solutions. Why didn't I think of this before? I don't know. Maybe this embarrassment is what I needed. */}
