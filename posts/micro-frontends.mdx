<WIP />
Micro-frontend is an architectural pattern that extends the concept of microservices
to the frontend. In traditional frontend development, a single monolithic frontend
application handles all aspects of the user interface and user experience. However,
as web applications grow in complexity, maintaining and scaling such monolithic applications
can become challenging. This is where the micro-frontend approach comes into play.

In a micro-frontend architecture, the frontend of a web application is decomposed into smaller, more manageable, and independent "micro" frontend modules. Each module is responsible for a specific part of the application's user interface and functionality. These modules can be developed, deployed, and maintained separately, allowing teams to work independently on different parts of the application. Each module can also be written using different technologies and frameworks, depending on the specific requirements.
